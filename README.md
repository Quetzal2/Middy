Middy is an Bot written for Discord for the Mega Shogun discord channel

The LFM does a bit of offloading to an external server via HTTP, this was to make life a little easier
with MySQL plus the server Middy runs on is a development server that doesn't have MySQL or some of the needed
packages to make this work efficiently

## Installation

if you want to contribute to Middy or just like running things, the following is how you can install and run your own instance of middy.

Before installing and running your own instance of middy, you will first need to install the following:

* Python 3.6
* Pip
* Dependencies: `python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Using Middy

If you decide to use middy you start the script by doing **python3 launch.py** do not run bot.py directly it won't work
Middy can run without the PHP Element as it links to the URL's used by my server, I do ask poliety if you can please remove the URLs or do not use the LFM Cog and disable it.
